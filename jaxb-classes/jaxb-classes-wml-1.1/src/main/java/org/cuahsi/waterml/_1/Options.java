     * Option elements are key-value pair elements that control how a variable maght be utilized in a service.
     *             Examples:
     *  MODIS web service. Information is aggreated over land or ocean or both. The plotarea option can include: plotarea=land, plotarea=land, plotarea=landocean
     * 
     * USGS uses a statistic code, 0003, to repesent a  value type of 'Average'. The USGS statistic codes also several options that do not fit the ODM data model. Gets the value of the option property.
     * 
     * <p>
     * This accessor method returns a reference to the live list,
     * not a snapshot. Therefore any modification you make to the
     * returned list will be present inside the JAXB object.
     * This is why there is not a <CODE>set</CODE> method for the option property.
     * 
     * <p>
     * For example, to add a new item, do as follows:
     * <pre>
     *    getOption().add(newItem);
     * </pre>
     * 
     *

     * {@link Option }
