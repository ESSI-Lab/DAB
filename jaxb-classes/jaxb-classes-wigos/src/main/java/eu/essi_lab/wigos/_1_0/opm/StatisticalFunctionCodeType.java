/**
 * The «CodeList» class 'StatisticalFunctionCode' specifies the type of statistical function
 *             that is applied to the base observable property to define the statistical summary;
 *             e.g. maximum air temperature.  Note that WMO provides two code-tables listing statistical
 *             operators:  - WMO No. 306 Vol I.2 Part B FM 92 GRIB code-table 4.10 'Type of statistical
 *             processing'; and - WMO No. 306 Vol I.2 Part B FM 94 BUFR code-table 0 08 023 'First-order
 *             statistics'  The GRIB2 code-table is defined as the 'recommended' vocabulary for this
 *             «CodeList» class but lacks some of the necessary terms. For example, the GRIB code-table
 *             includes 'Average' but does not include 'Mean', 'Mode' or 'Median' (which can be found
 *             in the BUFR code-table). However, the BUFR code-table is _NOT_ chosen because 'Accumulation'
 *             is entirely missing. Given that 'extensibility' is set to 'any', authors are free
 *             to refer to their preferred 'statistical operator' vocabulary. The GRIB code-table
 *             is only a recommendation. 
 *             
 *             vocabulary: http://codes.wmo.int/grib2/codeflag/4.10
 *             extensibility: any
 *
