		"description": "NASA's vision: To reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.\r\n\r\nTo do that, thousands of people have been working around the world -- and off of it -- for 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features. NASA's aeronautics team is working with other government organizations, universities, and industry to fundamentally improve the air transportation experience and retain our nation's leadership in global aviation.",

	"notes": "Electrical power systems play a critical role in spacecraft\r\nand aircraft, and they exhibit a rich variety of failure modes.\r\nThis paper discusses electrical power system fault diagnosis\r\nby means of probabilistic techniques. Speci\u0002cally, we discuss\r\nour development of a diagnostic capability for an electrical\r\npower system testbed, ADAPT, located at NASA Ames.\r\nWe emphasize how we have tackled two challenges, regarding\r\nmodelling and real-time performance, often encountered\r\nwhen developing diagnostic applications. We carefully discuss\r\nour Bayesian network modeling approach for electrical\r\npower systems. To achieve real-time performance, we build\r\non recent theoretically well-founded developments that compile\r\na Bayesian network into an arithmetic circuit. Arithmetic\r\ncircuits have low footprint and are optimized for embedded,\r\nreal-time systems such as spacecraft and aircraft.\r\nWe discuss our probabilistic diagnostic models developed for\r\nADAPT along with successful experimental results.",
