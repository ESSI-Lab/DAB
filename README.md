Welcome to the GitHub repository of the DAB Community Edition (CE). This repository includes all consolidated and stable functionalities of the DAB. 

## About the DAB

The DAB is a **brokering software framework** for the **mediation and harmonization of geospatial data** with particular reference to Earth observation data, both satellite and non-satellite. DAB makes it possible to connect heterogeneous data sources and make them discoverable and accessible through homogeneous and standard interfaces by different data user tools and applications. The DAB is capable of implementing data discovery and access functionalities by implementing multiple standard interfaces (e.g. OGC, ISO,  ...), and Application Programming Interfaces (API).

## Getting started
<details>
  <summary>Getting started</summary>

The DAB is composed by multiple maven modules. GS-service is the main module, capable of starting the DAB Internet services and its web configuration tool.

The command <code>mvn clean install</code> run in the root folder will package the jar files and finally the war package of DAB GS-service.

Finally, it's possible to launch DAB services  from the gs-service folder with the following maven command:

<code>mvn jetty:run -Ppreconfigured -DdbUser=XXX -DdbPassword=XXX -DquartzUser=root -DquartzPassword=XXX -DadminUser=XXX -DgoogleClientId=XXX -DgoogleClientSecret=XXX</code>

The DAB will launch using a preconfigured configuration where:
- dbUser/dbPassword are the credentials of a Marklogic db installed on localhost (8002/8004 ports)
- quartzUser/quartzPassword are the credentials of a mysql db installed on localhost  (3306 port)
- adminUser/googleClientId/googleClientSecret are the Google OAuth credentials previously obtained through Google
- an ElasticSearch instance installed on localhost will receive statistics (9200 port)

The DAB can then be configured at the URL: 

http://localhost:9090/gs-service/conf
	
It's also possible to create a brand new configuration at the URL:

http://localhost:9090/gs-service/initialize

The web configurator tool enables to add/remove both profilers and accessors. In this configuration all the profilers are activated. For the accessors, it's needed to specify the data source URL endpoint, the accessor strategy (distributed vs harvested) and the connector type. It's also possible to start harvestings of specific sources.

A demo portal to check that DAB is working as expected will be available at the URL:
	
http://localhost:9090/gs-service/search

## DAB history and acknowledgments

<details>
	<summary>DAB history and acknowledgments</summary>

The DAB was initially conceived and is still designed and developed by ESSI-Lab at Institute on Atmospheric Pollution Research (Florence division) of National Research Council of Italy.

DAB implements the **brokering approach** introduced by Stefano Nativi et al. in the position paper: <code>Nativi S, Craglia M, Pearlman J. The Brokering Approach for Multidisciplinary Interoperability: A Position Paper. International Journal of Spatial Data Infrastructures Research 7; 2012. p. 1-15. JRC78581.</code>

DAB software development took and takes place in the context of numerous international projects and initiatives, funded/operated by different entities on a time range of over 10 years.

Since 2012, the DAB framework has been leveraged by GEO as **GEO-DAB**, the brokerage component of the GEOSS Common Infrastructure (GCI; or GEOSS platform). GEO DAB is being operated and managed by CNR-IIA on its cloud infrastructure, it connects over 150 information systems that allow the search of over 400 million data (granules), and relative access if allowed by the provider.

[More info on GEO-DAB](https://www.geodab.net/)

The DAB framework is also currently adopted by WMO as a key component to realize the **WMO Hydrological Observing System (WHOS)**, a system of systems able to share hydrological data at a global scale.

[More info on WHOS](https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/water/whos)

[WHOS webinar recording](https://community.wmo.int/news/watch-recording-whos-webinar) is a valuable introduction to WHOS and its brokering component.

In the context of **SeaDataNet** the DAB framework is used to enable discovery of international ocean data sources.

DAB won the **2014 Geospatial World Innovation Awards** [(media coverage here)](https://www.cnr.it/en/news/5795/il-geospatial-world-innovation-award-all-iia-cnr).

The following papers provide a technical description of the DAB brokering framweork.

Many computer scientists and software engineers have contributed to DAB design and development throughout an implementation effort of over 10 years, spanning different maturity stages (from prototypical to operational)  and components (e.g. GI-cat, GI-axe, GI-sem, GI-suite, ...).
