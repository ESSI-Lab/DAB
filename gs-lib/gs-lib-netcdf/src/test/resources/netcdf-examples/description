The following example NetCDF types used in tests are described in the following NetCDF CF conventions 1.7 
exampleh2.nc -> Example H2 orthogonal multidimensional time series
exampleh3.nc -> Example H3 incomplete multidimensional time series
exampleh4.nc -> Example H4 single time series
exampleh5.nc -> Example H5 single time series with time varying deviations
exampleh6.nc -> Example H6 contiguous ragged array time series
exampleh7.nc -> Example H7 indexed ragged array time series
