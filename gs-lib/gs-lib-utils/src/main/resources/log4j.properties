# Log4j hierarchy, works in the following way: if a logger is set to level, e.g., ERROR -> only logs with level FATAL and ERROR are shown
#TRACE,
#DEBUG,
#INFO,
#WARN,
#ERROR
#FATAL

# the following is for production environment: level is set to info and written to console (CA) and to file FOUT (which has max size 10MB and 2 backup copies)
#log4j.rootLogger=INFO, CA, FOUT
#TODO maybe we can define the eu.flora logger to debug in file appender but log4j.logger.eu.flora=DEBUG, FOUT does not work and neither defing a different fileout

# the following is for production environment: the root logger level is set to info and written to console (CA)
#and eu.flora package logging is set to TRACE for debugging our code
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, CA
log4j.logger.eu.flora=TRACE
