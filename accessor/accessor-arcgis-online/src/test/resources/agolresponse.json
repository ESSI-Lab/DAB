Of course, siting criteria for each pollutant and monitoring objectives must be considered as well.

The bias estimation uses the nearest neighbors to each site to estimate the concentration at the location of the site if the site had never existed. This is done using the Voronoi Neighborhood Averaging algorithm with inverse distance squared weighting. The squared distance allows for higher weighting on concentrations at sites located closer to the site being examined. The bias was calculated for each day at each site by taking the difference between the predicted value from the interpolation and the actual measured concentration. A positive average bias indicates that if the site being examined was removed, the concentration estimated from neighboring sites would be larger than the measured concentration. Likewise, a negative average bias would suggest that the estimated concentration at the location of the site is smaller than the actual measured concentration.   Sites are ranked by the absolute value of the average bias, since both underestimates and overestimates of concentration would be undesirable.  Ranks are assigned by decile, with low bias given the highest rank of 4 and high bias given the lowest rank of 0.<\/span><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;'><\/span><\/p><p style='padding: 0px; font-size: 16.3636360168457px; line-height: normal; color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'><b><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;'>Ozone Correlation Rank<\/span><\/b><\/p><p style='padding: 0px; font-size: 16.3636360168457px; line-height: normal; color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;'>Monitors that are closely correlated are generally believed to be sampling from the same air mass and provide less unique information than less correlated monitors.

For example, scores for area served, which ranks monitors higher for greater areas, will naturally tend to value rural monitors most highly, because the rural network is sparse and each monitor is intended to represent a large geographic area.  In contrast, the scores for population served tend to value urban monitors more highly, because they are sited in areas of greatest population density.  To some extent, these two scores will cancel each other, although they are not perfect inverses.  Weighting one or the other of these in particular may have a significant effect on the composite score.  Rural monitors in general tend to be undervalued in this analysis because they also tend to be lower concentration monitors.  Despite their low concentrations, these monitors are particularly important for model validation, precisely because they provide information for the spaces between urban areas and allow us to better characterize air upwind and downwind. This analysis does not propose any specific monitors for shutdows, but only suggests potential candidates that might be examined more closely if site closures are necessary.<\/span><\/p><\/div>","tags":["monitor","air","ozone","rank"],"snippet":"Ozone Monitoring Network Ranking.","thumbnail":"thumbnail/thumbnail.png","documentation":null,"extent":[[-96.609102249,37.432146072000066],[-80.51862727299994,48.93569755600003]],"categories":[],"spatialReference":"WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere","accessInformation":null,"licenseInfo":"None.

The data are updated weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However, that does not necessarily mean the data have changed.<\/p><p>The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called &quot;criteria&quot; pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly found air pollutants (also known as &quot;criteria pollutants&quot;) are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants &quot;criteria&quot; air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards.<\/p><p>A geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called &quot;split areas&quot;) have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard.<\/p><p>A designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as \u201cattainment\u201d (meeting), \u201cnonattainment\u201d (not meeting), or \u201cunclassifiable\u201d (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions.<\/p><p>For further information, please refer to: <a href='https://www.epa.gov/green-book'>https://www.epa.gov/green-book<\/a>.

They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants &quot;criteria&quot; air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards.<\/p><p>A geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called &quot;split areas&quot;) have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard.<\/p><p>A designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as \u201cattainment\u201d (meeting), \u201cnonattainment\u201d (not meeting), or \u201cunclassifiable\u201d (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions.<\/p><p>For further information, please refer to: <a href='https://www.epa.gov/green-book'>https://www.epa.gov/green-book<\/a>. Questions concerning the status of nonattainment areas, their classification and EPA policy should be directed to the appropriate Regional Offices. EPA Headquarters should be contacted only when the Regional Office is unable to answer a question.<\/p><p>Supplemental info:<\/p><p><a href='https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/'>https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/<\/a> - Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards web site <a href='https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table'>https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table<\/a>- National Ambient Air Quality Standards web page<\/p>","tags":["Environmental Protection Agency","EPA","federal","state","tribal","government","National","ambient","air quality","standards","NAAQS","nonattainment","designations","design values","pollutants","criteria pollutants","pollution","public health","Air Data","county","environment","ozone","O3","United States","exposure","monitoring","regulatory","conservation","attainment","maintenance","Clean Air Act","Green Book","1997","8-hour","earth observations"],"snippet":"This map service identifies areas in the U.S. where air pollution levels have not met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for 8-hour Ozone and have been designated nonattainment based on 1997 NAAQS review.
