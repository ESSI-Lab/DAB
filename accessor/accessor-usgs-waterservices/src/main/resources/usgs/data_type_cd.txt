all	default (see above for qualifications). This is equivalent to &seriesCatalogOutput=true.
iv	Instantaneous values (time-series measurements typically recorded by automated equipment at frequent intervals (e.g., hourly)
uv	Instantaneous values (time-series measurements typically recorded by automated equipment at frequent intervals (e.g., hourly)
rt	Real-time data (alias for iv). Note: use of rv does not restrict time-series data to only those with real-time data.
dv	Daily values (once daily measurements or summarized information for a particular day, such as daily maximum, minimum and mean)
pk	Peak measurements of water levels and streamflow for surface water sites (such as during floods, may be either an automated or a manual measurement)
sv	Site visits (irregular manual surface water measurements, excluding peak measurements)
gw	Groundwater levels measured at irregular, discrete intervals. For recorded, time series groundwater levels, use iv or id.
qw	Water-quality data from discrete sampling events and analyzed in the field or in a laboratory. For recorded time series water-quality data, use iv or id.
id	Historical instantaneous values (sites in the USGS Instantaneous Data Archive External Link)
aw	Sites monitored by the USGS Active Groundwater Level Network External Link
