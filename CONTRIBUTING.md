## How to contribute to this project

Contributors to the ESSI-Lab DAB project are welcome: you can report bugs and request enhancements contacting ESSI-Lab or through the GitHub issue tracker.

To propose code contributions please contact ESSI-Lab to coordinate the development effort and avoid duplications.

The ESSI-Lab Contributor License Agreement (based on HA-CLA-I-OSI) needs to be signed by contributors to enable ESSI-Lab to accept community contributions to the DAB repository even more smoothly. Now the signature of the agreement is fully integrated in the Github pull request.

If you're interested in contributing, please take a look as well at ESSI-Lab's Contributor Code of Conduct.
